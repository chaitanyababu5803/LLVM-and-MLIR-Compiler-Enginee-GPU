LLVM-and-MLIR-Compiler-EngineeR tutorials online
Finding quality tutorials for LLVM and MLIR can be a bit like navigating a complex codebase itself—there’s a lot to dig through. Here’s a breakdown of the most solid entry points and structured learning paths available today. 
Core MLIR Learning Paths
The "Toy" Tutorial: This is the gold standard for beginners. It walks you through building a compiler for a simple language ("Toy"), covering everything from AST to emitting basic MLIR and lowering to LLVM IR.
MLIR for Beginners (Jeremy Kun): A highly recommended, modern blog series that fills in the gaps left by official documentation. It covers build systems with Bazel, writing your first pass, and using Tablegen.
End-to-End MLIR Pipeline: A very recent (2026) community effort designed specifically for newcomers to see how MLIR fits into a full compilation flow, from ML framework models to native binaries. 

Comprehensive Video Series
"How to Build a Compiler" (Serene Project): This YouTube playlist is a deep dive that uses a practical language project (Serene) to explain LLVM and MLIR basics in an accessible way.
LLVM Developers' Meetings: For deep architectural dives, the MLIR Tutorial video from 2020 by Mehdi Amini and River Riddle is a classic. 

Essential Documentation & Hands-on Materials
Official LLVM/MLIR Docs: The Getting Started guide is your first stop for setup, while the Transform Dialect Tutorial is best for learning how to schedule transformations.
Workshop Codebases: The LambdaClass MLIR Workshop provides a prepared codebase to help you compile expressions and functions hands-on. 

Career & Skill Context
If you are looking at this for a specific role, keep in mind that companies like NVIDIA actively recruit for "LLVM and MLIR Compiler Engineer" interns, emphasizing skills in LLVM-based optimizations and heterogeneous hardware. 
Are you looking to build a domain-specific language (DSL) or are you more interested in hardware-specific optimizations?
